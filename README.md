**Original Project (Love 0.10.2):**

Some users may find that 0.10.2 doesn't work for them, and so using the latest version is the only answer. Instead of having to figure out how to update each and every change in Love 11.2, I have instead provided what is needed with this repository. 

**You can also view these breaking changes from the Love site:**

### How to Run

* cd into the directory of the project version (e.g. pong-0)
* archive the files with a zip format, using a .love extension

Linux/OSX

```
$ zip -r pong.love *
```

* Open the love file in the Love app. Those with access to love in the CLI:

```
$ love pong.love
```

OR

```
$ love .
```
